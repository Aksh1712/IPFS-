Step 2: Add the Sepolia Test Network
Since the Ethereum mainnet uses real ETH, test networks like Sepolia are used for practice.

What Was Done:
Opened MetaMask network settings.
Selected or added the Sepolia Test Network.
Switched from Ethereum mainnet to Sepolia.

Note: Using test networks allows learning without using real money.

Step 3: Get Sepolia ETH from Faucet
Test ETH is required to simulate transactions.

What Was Done:
Visited the Google Cloud Faucet site.
Pasted MetaMask wallet address.
Clicked on "Request Tokens".
Verified token receipt in MetaMask.

Note: Sepolia ETH is only for testing purposes and has no real value.

Step 4: Transfer Sepolia ETH Between Accounts
To simulate a real transaction, ETH was sent from one account to another.

What Was Done:
Created a second MetaMask account.
Copied the new account's address.
Used the first account to send 0.01 ETH to the second account.
Verified the transfer.

Conclusion
This exercise demonstrated how to:

Create and manage a MetaMask wallet
Connect to a test network (Sepolia)
Request and use test ETH
Send ETH between accounts
These steps build a basic understanding of Ethereum wallets, testnets, and transactions in a development environment.

Learning Outcome: Practical experience with wallets, test ETH, and network setup prepares users for blockchain development and testing.
